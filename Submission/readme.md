The way to run the code:

1. We am using D3 to create the code. All the data I used is from “pollution_us_2000_2016.csv”. 

2. We use ipython to creates some data directly produce the visualizations, which the files are “co.csv”, “no2.csv”, “o3.csv”, 

 “so2.csv”, "YCO.csv", "YNO2.csv", "YO3.csv", "YSO2.csv" and "four state aqi.csv". 
 
 We also put all "ipynb" files in the data file folder.
 
 3. To run our codes, just use local server to run the html code. It will directly shows our visualizations.
